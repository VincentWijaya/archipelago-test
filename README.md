# Web Developer Screening Questions - Senior Fullstack Candidate

## Basic Questions

### Photo Moderation System Design

For a photo submission and moderation system, I'd opt for a robust backend managing the photo states.

**Logic Design:**
When a user uploads a photo, it would initially be set to a `pending` status. An API endpoint (e.g., `/api/photos/upload`) would handle the file upload and metadata. The photo file itself would be stored in object storage like AWS S3, with its URL saved in our database. Photos in `pending` status would populate a moderation dashboard. Moderators could 'Approve' (changing status to `published` for public visibility) or 'Reject' (changing status to `rejected`, potentially with a reason) the photos. Notifications could be triggered to inform the user of the moderation outcome.

**Technologies:**
* **Backend:** Node.js with Express for flexibility, or Golang for performance and concurrency if image processing were a future consideration.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL for its ACID compliance and structured nature, ideal for photo metadata and user info.
* **File Storage:** AWS S3 for scalable and reliable object storage.
* **Frontend:** Vue.js or React for an interactive user and moderator interface.

**Data Structure (PostgreSQL example for `photos` table):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE photos (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY, -- or auto-incrementing integer
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
    s3_url VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'published', 'rejected')),
    upload_timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    moderation_timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    moderator_id INT REFERENCES employees(id), -- or moderators table
    rejection_reason TEXT,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT,
    tags JSONB -- or a separate photo_tags join table
);
```

This design ensures a clear audit trail and efficient querying based on moderation status.

## Database Questions

### Level 1 (Novice)
To count customers from Germany:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID)
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Germany';
```
This query shows how many customers there are from Germany.

### Level 2 (Business Admin)
To list countries by customer count (most to least, min 5 customers):
```sql
SELECT Country, COUNT(CustomerID)
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) >= 5
ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;
```

### Level 3 (Average Developer)
Reverse engineering the provided results, the query to get customer order counts, first order, and last order dates:
```sql
SELECT
    c.CustomerName,
    COUNT(o.OrderID) AS OrderCount,
    MIN(o.OrderDate) AS FirstOrder,
    MAX(o.OrderDate) AS LastOrder
FROM
    Customers c
    INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
GROUP BY
    c.CustomerName
HAVING
	COUNT(o.OrderID) >= 5
ORDER BY
    MAX(o.OrderDate) desc;
```

## JavaScript/TypeScript Questions
### Level 1.1: Title Case Function
```javascript
function titleCase(str) {
  if (!str) return "";

  const words = str.toLowerCase().split(' ');

  const capitalizedWords = words.map(word => {
    const firstLetter = word.charAt(0).toUpperCase();
    const restOfWord = word.slice(1);
    return firstLetter + restOfWord;
  });

  return capitalizedWords.join(' ');
}

// âœ… Test Cases
console.log(`"I'm a little tea pot" should return a string: ${typeof titleCase("I'm a little tea pot") === 'string'}`);
console.log(`"I'm a little tea pot" should return "I'm A Little Tea Pot": "${titleCase("I'm a little tea pot")}"`);
console.log(`"sHoRt AnD sToUt" should return "Short And Stout": "${titleCase("sHoRt AnD sToUt")}"`);
console.log(`"SHORT AND STOUT" should return "Short And Stout": "${titleCase("SHORT AND STOUT")}"`);
```

### Level 1.2: Word Frequency Counter

```javascript
function wordFrequencyCounter(text) {
  const wordCounts = {};

  const words = text.toLowerCase().split(/\s+/);

  for (const word of words) {
    if (!word) continue;

    if (wordCounts[word]) {
      wordCounts[word] += 1;
    } else {
      wordCounts[word] = 1;
    }
  }

  return wordCounts;
}

// Test Case
const testString = "Four One two two three Three three four four four";
const result = wordFrequencyCounter(testString);
console.log(result);

/*
Expected Output:
{
  one: 1,
  two: 2,
  three: 3,
  four: 4
}
*/
```
### Level 2: Fix delay with Promises

```javascript
function delay(ms) {
  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}

// Example usage:
delay(3000).then(() => console.log('runs after 3 seconds'));
```
### Level 2.5: Async/await
```javascript
// Convert fetchData to return a Promise
function fetchDataPromise(url) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (!url) {
        reject("URL is required");
      } else {
        resolve(`Data from ${url}`);
      }
    }, 1000);
  });
}

// Convert processData to return a Promise
function processDataPromise(data) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (!data) {
        reject("Data is required");
      } else {
        resolve(data.toUpperCase());
      }
    }, 1000);
  });
}

// Rewrite using Async/Await
async function processWorkflow(url) {
  try {
    const data = await fetchDataPromise(url);
    const processedData = await processDataPromise(data);
    console.log("Processed Data:", processedData);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Process Error:", error);
  }
}

// Example usage:
processWorkflow("[https://example.com](https://example.com)");
processWorkflow(null); // To test the error case
```

### Level 3-4 (See livechat folder)

## Vue.js

#### Explain Vue.js reactivity and common issues when tracking changes.

Vue's reactivity system efficiently updates the DOM by converting data properties into reactive getters and setters. When a reactive property is used in a component, Vue tracks it as a dependency. Upon a change, the setter triggers an update, leading to a targeted re-render of affected components using a virtual DOM.

Common Issues:

- **Adding new properties to reactive objects (Vue 2)**: Directly adding this.myObject.newProp = 'value' wasn't reactive. Solved by Vue.set() or creating a new object. Vue 3 (using Proxies) largely resolves this.
- **Directly modifying array indices or length (Vue 2)**: this.myArray[index] = newValue or this.myArray.length = 0 were not reactive. Required array methods (splice, push). Vue 3's Proxies handle these better.
- **Using non-reactive data**: Data not properly declared as reactive won't trigger updates.
- **Asynchronous updates**: Vue batches DOM updates. nextTick() is needed to access DOM after a reactive change.
- **Nested object/array changes**: While Vue 3 is improved, deeply nested changes might still require re-assigning entire objects/arrays for optimal reactivity.

#### Describe data flow between components in a Vue.js app

Vue's data flow is primarily unidirectional, ensuring predictability and maintainability.

1. **Props Down, Events Up**:
1.1 **Props Down**: Parent components pass data to children via props. Children should treat props as immutable.
1.2 **Events Up**: Children communicate back to parents by emitting custom events. Parents listen for these events and update their own data, which then flows down.
2. **Slots**: Allow parent components to inject content into specific areas of a child's template, providing flexible component composition.
3. **Provide/Inject**: Used for passing data deeply to nested components without "prop-drilling." A parent provides data, and any descendant can inject it. Used cautiously, as it can obscure data flow.
4. **State Management Libraries (Vuex/Pinia)**: For larger applications, a centralized store (like Pinia or Vuex) acts as a single source of truth. Components commit mutations or dispatch actions to update the store, and read state directly from it.

#### List the most common cause of memory leaks in Vue.js apps and how they can be solved.

Memory leaks in Vue apps occur when references to objects persist unexpectedly, preventing garbage collection.

1. **Event Listeners Not Cleaned Up**: Adding ```window.addEventListener``` or custom event listeners in ```mounted()``` but failing to ```removeEventListener``` in ```beforeUnmount()``` (or ```destroyed()``` in Vue 2).
2. **Timers Not Cleared**: ```setInterval``` or ```setTimeout``` calls not being ```clearInterval``` or ```clearTimeout``` in ```beforeUnmount()```.
3. **Unsubscribed Subscriptions**: Failing to unsubscribe from observables (e.g., RxJS) or close WebSocket connections when the component is unmounted.
4. **Global Objects/Caches Holding References**: Components registering with a global object or third-party library without deregistering upon unmount.
5. **Improper ```v-if``` vs ```v-show``` use**: ```v-show``` only toggles visibility, keeping components mounted, which can accumulate leaks if not properly managed, whereas ```v-if``` truly mounts/unmounts.
6. The key solution is to clean up what you set up: if you create or open something in ```mounted()``` (or similar lifecycle hooks), ensure it's destroyed or closed in ```beforeUnmount()```.
